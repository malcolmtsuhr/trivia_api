# Full Stack Trivia API Backend

## Getting Started

### Installing Dependencies

#### Python 3.9

Follow instructions to install the latest version of python for your platform in the [python docs](https://docs.python.org/3/using/unix.html#getting-and-installing-the-latest-version-of-python)

### Github repo setup **Create an empty repository in your Github account online. To change the remote repository path in your local repository, use the commands below:**
```
git remote -v
git remote remove origin
git remote add origin <https://github.com/<USERNAME>/<REPO_NAME>.git>
git branch -M master
```
Once you have finished editing your code, you can push the local repository to your Github account using the following commands.
```
git add . --all   
git commit -m "your comment"
git push -u origin master
```

#### Virtual Enviornment

Install:
python3 -m pip install --user virtualenv

Create Virtual Environment:
python3 -m venv env

Activate Virtual Environment:
source env/bin/activate

We recommend working within a virtual environment whenever using Python for projects. This keeps your dependencies for each project separate and organaized. Instructions for setting up a virual enviornment for your platform can be found in the [python docs](https://packaging.python.org/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/)

#### PIP Dependencies

Once you have your virtual environment setup and running, install dependencies by naviging to the `/backend` directory and running:

```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

This will install all of the required packages we selected within the `requirements.txt` file.

##### Key Dependencies

- [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/)  is a lightweight backend microservices framework. Flask is required to handle requests and responses.

- [SQLAlchemy](https://www.sqlalchemy.org/) is the Python SQL toolkit and ORM we'll use handle the lightweight sqlite database. You'll primarily work in app.py and can reference models.py.

- [Flask-CORS](https://flask-cors.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#) is the extension we'll use to handle cross origin requests from our frontend server.

## Database Setup
With Postgres running, restore a database using the trivia.psql file provided. Update the database owner to match the local username. From the backend folder in terminal run:
```bash
createdb trivia
psql trivia < trivia.psql
```

## Running the server

From within the `backend` directory first ensure you are working using your created virtual environment.

To run the server, execute:

```bash
export FLASK_APP=flaskr
export FLASK_ENV=development
flask run
```

Setting the `FLASK_ENV` variable to `development` will detect file changes and restart the server automatically.

Setting the `FLASK_APP` variable to `flaskr` directs flask to use the `flaskr` directory and the `__init__.py` file to find the application.
